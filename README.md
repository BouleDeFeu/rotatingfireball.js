rotatingfireball.js
===================

Simple, beautiful, functional yet powerful Javascript utility that
replaces your old and crumsy favicon with an endlessly rotating fireball.

Feel the true meaning of freedom and power[1]! PNG? JPEG? Pft, these are
so 90's: all you need is Javascript.

There is a minified version of `rotatingfireball.js` for people so
cheap on bandwith they can't distribute a 4K text file.

To use just add `id="favicon"` to your favicon element and append
`<script src="javascripts/rotatingfireball.min.js">` at the end of your
page!
