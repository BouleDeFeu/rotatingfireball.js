rotatingfireball.js
===================

Simple, beautiful, functional yet powerful Javascript utility that
replaces your old and crumsy favicon with an endlessly rotating fireball.

Feel the true meaning of freedom and power[1]!

There is a minified version of `rotatingfireball.js` for people so
cheap on bandwith they can't distribute a 4K text file.
